CHATBOT:
Hi! ðŸ˜Š Since you're ready to start, could you please tell me what you'd like to make? I can help put together a recipe and some shopping lists for you. ðŸ˜„

USER: 
i want to make mochi

CHATBOT:
That's awesome! Mochi is a fun and delicious treat. ðŸ˜‹

To make sure you have everything you need, here's a simple recipe:

Ingredients:

1 cup mochiko (sweet rice flour)
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup water
Potato starch or cornstarch, for dusting

Instructions:
1. In a microwave-safe bowl, whisk together the mochiko, sugar, and salt.
2. Gradually whisk in the water until the mixture is smooth.
3. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave on high for 2 minutes.
4. Stir the mixture and microwave for another minute. Repeat this step until the mochi is translucent and pulls away from the sides of the bowl (about 2-4 minutes more).
5. Dust a work surface with potato starch or cornstarch. Turn the mochi out onto the surface and let it cool slightly.
6. Once cool enough to handle, knead the mochi for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
7. Divide the mochi into desired portions and shape as desired.
