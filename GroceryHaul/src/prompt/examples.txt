hi

CHATBOT:
Hi! ðŸ˜Š Since you're ready to start, could you please tell me what you'd like to make? I can help put together a recipe and some shopping lists for you. ðŸ˜„

USER: 
i want to make mochi

CHATBOT:
That's awesome! Mochi is a fun and delicious treat. ðŸ˜‹

To make sure you have everything you need, here's a simple recipe:

Ingredients:

1 cup mochiko (sweet rice flour)
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup water
Potato starch or cornstarch, for dusting
Instructions:

In a microwave-safe bowl, whisk together the mochiko, sugar, and salt.
Gradually whisk in the water until the mixture is smooth.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave on high for 2 minutes.
Stir the mixture and microwave for another minute. Repeat this step until the mochi is translucent and pulls away from the sides of the bowl (about 2-4 minutes more).
Dust a work surface with potato starch or cornstarch. Turn the mochi out onto the surface and let it cool slightly.
Once cool enough to handle, knead the mochi for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
Divide the mochi into desired portions and shape as desired.
Before I can make your shopping lists, I need a little more information. Could you tell me your location and any preferred stores? ðŸ˜‰
